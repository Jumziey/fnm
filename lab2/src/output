Given the command-line
phonons Xe cv 0.1
Your program should exit with a zero status and print some result on
standard output. Yours does not.
Your program exits with status 0

Given the command-line
phonons Xe gamma 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 7
Your program should exit with a zero status and print some result on
standard output. Yours does not.
Your program exits with status 0

Given the command-line
phonons Ne cv 0.1 0.2 100
Your program should exit with a zero status and print some result on
standard output. Yours does not.
Your program exits with status 0
Your program tries to calculate gamma for q=(0,0,0). Please note
that gamma is not defined in this point (there is no well-defined
limit of gamma as q tends to zero). In this case there should be no
output on standard output.
-- There are something lacking in your program's behaviour

-- Your program does not properly calculate gamma
Since your program passes the test for the phonons, you are probably just
calculating the derivative erroneously. Check that you are using the correct
formula etc.
